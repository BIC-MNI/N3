List of bugs, oversights and unwanted features of N3.
Updated Aug. 9, 1999

Version 1.0 (old versioning scheme)
------------------------------------------------------------ 

The make_template command assumes the MINC header will be less than 16k.
This may cause evaluate_field to crash if template header has been
truncated.  
> changed to 32k in release 1.02

mv command is not registered in nu_evaluate script.
> fixed in release 1.02

Software doesn't compile on g++ versions that don't support -O3.

spline_smooth doesn't check that output file is writable until after
computing field.

evaluate_field may compute a different number of basis functions than 
spline_smooth did as a result of round off errors.

Version 1.1 (old versioning scheme)
------------------------------------------------------------ 
Path.c doesn't work correctly with the bash shell since it doesn't
have a PWD variable.
> fixed in release 1.04

On SGIs the compiler should be CC not DCC to take advantage of the
new formats.

Version 1.02
------------------------------------------------------------ 
volume_hist crashes if image min and max are same
> fixed in 1.02c

nu_correct fails rather mysteriously if the mask volume is empty
> fixed in 1.04

The code for bining in volume_hist may not handle the last bin correctly. 

The imp generation stage of nu_estimate_np_and_em may fail due to under
sampling of smooth volume.
> fixed in 1.03.   Note: this fix changes the results of the algorithm
slightly ( less than 0.3% for test suite ).

The intensity scaling of the output volume can be quite different than the
input.
> While this isn't a bug, an option has been added to nu_estimate_np_and_em to
correct for this in version 1.03.
> This option has been added to the nu_estimate/nu_correct scripts as of 1.04

Version 1.03
------------------------------------------------------------
A new verison of the test data is needed for the quantitative tests.
> fixed 1.04

float volumes created by evaluate_field may suffer round off problems
> fixed in 1.04
 
mincblur is required but not really necessary most of the time
> fixed in 1.04
