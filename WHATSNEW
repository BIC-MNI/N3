What has changed in release 1.05 of the MNI N3 package.

The functionality of release 1.05 is unchanged from that of 1.04.  
A number of minor changes have been made to the code, Makefiles, and
configuration script to allow it to build with gcc 2.95.  A number
of additional changes have been made which (I hope) will allow it
to compile on Solaris machines without complaint.

What has changed in release 1.04 of the MNI N3 package.

The most important change with 1.04 is that the code can now be compiled
with the new egcs version (1.0 or later) of g++.  This means the current
distributions of Linux, most of which come with egcs, should now be able to
compile N3.

Release 1.04 fixes a number of bugs from release 1.02.  Among these,
a change to the way the .imp correction field is produced at the final
stage means that the new version produces slightly different results than
previous versions (typically by ~ 0.3%).  Also, MNI_AUTOREG is no longer
needed to install N3.  For more information on bugs fixed in this release
see the file CHANGES.
