	* Make nu_estimate_np_and_em.in invariant to voxel steps (via
  	  spline_smooth in EBTKS)
	* Free memory after usage

2008-06-10  Andrew L Janke <a.janke@gmail.com>
	* updated README, merged CHANGES and WHATSNEW into NEWS
	* src/NUcorrect/nu_estimate_np_and_EM: added code to check on
	  (deprecated) use of the EM section and thus spit a warning
	* epm-header.in: removed netcdf dependency

2006-04-29  Claude Lepage  <claude@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
	* change xPERLx to @PERL@, etc. 

2006-04-27  Claude Lepage  <claude@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
	* repackaging for minc2 m4 files

2005-03-16  Andrew Janke   <a.janke@gmail.com>
	* Changed from MNI:DataDir to FindBin for binary distribution
	* Added epm-header.in for binary distribution

2005-03-08  Bert Vincent   <bert@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
	* src/SharpenHist/sharpen_hist.cc uses finite(), which is not
	  available on many versions of Solaris.  Added a test to look for
	  isfinite() as well as finite() in configure.in
	* src/EvaluateField/evaluateField.cc,
	  src/SplineSmooth/splineSmooth.cc, src/VolumeHist/minchist.cc
	  Get rid of redundant #define N_DIMENSIONS 3, which duplicates
	  the definition in volume_io.h and generates a warning.	

2004-11-18  Bert Vincent   <bert@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
	* src/ExtractTag/extracttag.c - minor change to argTable[] to 
	  reflect the fact that -mintags and -maxtags take 'long' arguments
	  rather than 'int' arguments.  This was pointed out as a potential 
	  issue on 64-bit platforms by Yasunari Tosa of MGH.
	
2004-11-17  Bert Vincent   <bert@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
	* nu_estimate_np_and_em.in - fixed CreateMask to work properly
	  if the user-provided mask file winds up having the same name
	  as the internally generated temporary mask file.  This should only
	  happen when the user-specified file is compressed, or otherwise
	  needs processing before it can be used.  This problem sometimes
	  resulted in test case #14 failing.
	 
2004-03-26  Bert Vincent   <bert@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
	* volumeStats.cc - Use the standard DBL_MAX and float.h rather
	  than the less standard MAXDOUBLE.

2004-03-16  Bert Vincent   <bert@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
	* configure.in - Update such that the tests for lapack and blas
	  can work on Debian Linux (specifically audrey.bic.mni.mcgill.ca)

2004-02-05  Bert Vincent   <bert@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
	* make_template.in - Apply edit suggested by John Sled which 
	  avoids the "excessively large header" problem by using the entire
	  output file as a template.

2004-01-29  Bert Vincent   <bert@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
	* Makefile.am - turn on execute bits for scripts, uncomment SUBDIRS 
	  so that the tests can be included.
	* testing/do_test.in - several minor fixes to deal with newer autoconf
	  directory layout.
	* testing/Makefile.am - added, to enable 'make check'.
	* configure.in - add testing/Makefile to the AC_CONFIG_FILES list.

2003-11-25  Steve ROBBINS  <stever@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
	* configure.in: Set version to 1.07.
	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): 
	* VERSION: Remove.

	* configure.in: Obtain version number from automake variable
	  $VERSION, rather than file named "VERSION".
	* Makefile.am (lapack_link_flags): Ensure lapack and blas appear
	  after $(LIBS) on link line, since LIBS contains "-lEBTKS", which
	  is what needs lapack.

2003-11-16  Steve ROBBINS  <stever@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
	* INSTALL: Explain lapack and clapack options.  Minor wording
	  changes.
	* configure.in: Probe for MNI volume_io library.  Probe for
	  FORTRAN BLAS and LAPACK using macro from ac-archive; probe for
	  CLAPACK if that fails.

2003-11-14  Steve ROBBINS  <stever@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
	* configure.in: Set version to 1.06.
	* src/VolumeStats/VolumeStatsArgs.cc: 
	* src/VolumeStats/volumeStats.cc: 
	* src/VolumeHist/args.cc: 
	* src/SplineSmooth/splineSmoothArgs.cc: 
	* src/SharpenHist/sharpen_hist.cc: 
	* src/SharpenHist/args.cc: 
	* src/EvaluateField/evaluateFieldArgs.cc: Use namespace std;

2003-09-02  Steve M. Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>
	* autogen.sh: Create directory ac_config_aux.

2003-04-16  Bert Vincent <bert@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
	* fully autoconf'd
	* Extracted EBTKS, math libraries
